# Introduction

Our project will be a cryptocurrency information site. It will be hosted for users who are interested in learning more about cryptocurrency. We will utilize different online resources in helping us accomplish this. Our plan is to also incorporate various elements within the site to give a more interactive website.

Some features we plan on including is a way to display current cypto prices. This includes crypto like Bitcoin, Ethereum, Dogecoin, etc. We also will show relevant topics around cryptocurrency, such as a news feed. We also have been planning a potential chat bot or way to dig into analyzing cryptocurrencies on this site.

# Anticipated Technologies

We will be using Vue.js, JavaScript, HTML, CSS, and a place for free web hosting! 

# Method/Approach

Our estimated plan of attack will be to create our website incremently using Agile as our process model. Generally speaking, we will structure the website, create the website, add any APIs, get our website up in running on a webhost, then continue to add plugins and other features that we think of as we create the project. 

# Estimated Timeline

This is our expected timeline for this project

# Anticipated Problems

Moving forward with the project, the biggest challenge will likely be the learning curve required for the team to get familiar with using frameworks, APIs, and just general web development techniques and styles. Finding time to all meet together may also be challenging due to everyone's schedules being somewhat conflicting and changing often. Currently, we are meeting on Tuesdays at 6:30pm, but to find another time slot, if necassary, it would likely have to be at a pretty odd time in order to accomodate everyone. Lastly, originality may be something that takes some time to figure out because there are so many existing websites with similar concepts so we will have to find ways to differentiate ours from others.
