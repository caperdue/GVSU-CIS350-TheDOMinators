# Introduction

Our project will be a cryptocurrency information site. It will be hosted for users who are interested in learning more about cryptocurrency. We will utilize different online resources in helping us accomplish this. Our plan is to also incorporate various elements within the site to give a more interactive website.

Some features we plan on including is a way to display current cypto prices. This includes crypto like Bitcoin, Ethereum, Dogecoin, etc. We also will show relevant topics around cryptocurrency, such as a news feed. We also have been planning a potential chat bot or way to dig into analyzing cryptocurrencies on this site.

# Anticipated Technologies

We will be using Vue.js, JavaScript, HTML, CSS, and a place for free web hosting! 

# Method/Approach

Our estimated plan of attack will be to create our website incremently using Agile as our process model. Generally speaking, we will structure the website, create the website, add any APIs, get our website up in running on a webhost, then continue to add plugins and other features that we think of as we create the project.
